## PDB Database

The [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (or PDB) is the second oldest database and is the main one for biomolecular structure data.

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats[] <- lapply(stats, function(x) as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x)))
head(stats)
```

Here is how you write it as a function:
```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x){
  y <- gsub(",","",x)
  ##G sub makes it , to no ,
  return (sum(as.numeric(y)))
}
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Neutron)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum (stats$Total)
```

```{r}
xray.sum/total.sum*100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
protein.sum <- stats["Protein (only)","Total"]
protein.sum/total.sum*100
```
86% of the structures are proteins.

## Visualizing with Mol-star

We will be analyzing the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG`
Mol-star homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

## Using bio3d package in R

Bio3D package can help focus on structural bioinformatics analysis. It allows us to read and analyze PDB data.

```{r}
library (bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```
```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

We will see atom data with `pdb$atom`
```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```
```{r}
head(pdbseq(pdb))
```
We can make 3D visualizations we can use
```{r}
#library(bio3dview)
#library(NGLVieweR)

#view.pdb(pdb, colorScheme = "sse", backgroundColor = "skyblue") |>
#  setSpin()
```

```{r}
#library (bio3d)
#sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)
#view.pdb(pdb, highlight = sel,
#         highlight.style = "spacefill")
```

## Predicting Functional Motions of a Single Structure

Normal Mode Analysis (NMA)

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
```
```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot (m)
```
```{r}
#view.nma(m)
```
We can write out a trajectory of  predicted dynamics and view it in Mol-star
```{r}
#mktrj(m, file="nma.pdb")
```
